# Booking Process Optimization Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the booking process optimization plan.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Development Branch
- Created a new branch `feature/booking-optimization` for all development work.

### Step 2: Create Core Components

#### 2.1 Create Bay Availability Service
- Created a dedicated endpoint for checking bay availability for a specific timeslot: `app/api/availability/check/route.ts`
- Optimized Google Calendar API calls with reduced fields and timeouts
- Added error handling and timeout management

#### 2.2 Create Booking Data Formatter Utility
- Created a utility for consistent data formatting across all services: `utils/booking-formatter.ts`
- Implemented standardized formatting for calendar, email, and LINE notifications
- Added helper functions for date/time calculations and description generation

#### 2.3 Create Parallel Processing Utility
- Created a utility for executing tasks in parallel: `utils/parallel-processing.ts`
- Added timeout handling for parallel tasks
- Implemented proper TypeScript types for better type safety

#### 2.4 Create Booking Orchestrator
- Created the central booking orchestration endpoint: `app/api/bookings/create/route.ts`
- Implemented profile updates, booking creation, and CRM mapping
- Added performance tracking and timing logs

#### 2.5 Create Dedicated Calendar Event Creator
- Created a specialized endpoint for calendar event creation: `app/api/bookings/calendar/create/route.ts`
- Implemented bay availability checking, calendar event creation, and notification sending
- Used the booking formatter utility for consistent data formatting

### Step 3: Keep TimeSlots Component Unchanged
- Kept the `TimeSlots.tsx` component unchanged
- Ensured it continues to use the existing `/api/availability` endpoint

### Step 4: Update Notification Endpoints

#### 4.1 Update Email Notification Endpoint
- Updated the email notification API to handle standardized data: `app/api/notifications/email/route.ts`
- Added support for the standardized data format from the formatter utility
- Maintained backward compatibility for legacy calls

#### 4.2 Update LINE Notification Endpoint
- Updated the LINE notification API to handle standardized data: `app/api/notifications/line/route.ts`
- Added support for the standardized data format from the formatter utility
- Maintained backward compatibility for legacy calls

### Step 5: Update Frontend Integration

#### 5.1 Update BookingDetails Component
- Updated the BookingDetails component to use the new API endpoints: `app/(features)/bookings/components/booking/steps/BookingDetails.tsx`
- Simplified the booking submission process
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### Step 6: Testing Phase
- This step would be performed after implementation

### Step 7: Deployment
- This step would be performed after testing

### Step 8: Old Files Handling

#### 8.1 Files to Be Deprecated
- Added deprecation notices to `app/api/bookings/calendar/route.ts`

#### 8.2 Files to Update
- Updated `app/(features)/bookings/components/booking/steps/BookingDetails.tsx`
- Updated `app/api/notifications/email/route.ts`
- Updated `app/api/notifications/line/route.ts`

#### 8.3 Files to Keep Unchanged
- Kept `app/(features)/bookings/components/booking/steps/TimeSlots.tsx` unchanged
- Kept `app/(features)/bookings/hooks/useAvailability.ts` unchanged
- Kept `app/api/availability/route.ts` unchanged

#### 8.4 Files to Remove After Successful Deployment
- This step would be performed after successful deployment

## Performance Improvements

The optimized booking process includes several performance improvements:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Operations that can run in parallel now do so from the start
2. **Reduced API Calls**: Eliminated redundant API calls between frontend and backend
3. **Optimized Calendar Queries**: Limited fields returned from Google Calendar API
4. **Timeout Handling**: Added timeouts to prevent long-running requests
5. **Consistent Data Formatting**: Centralized data formatting for all services

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing of all new components
2. Deploy to production
3. Monitor performance and make adjustments as needed
4. Remove deprecated files after successful deployment
